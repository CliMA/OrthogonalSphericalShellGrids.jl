OrthogonalSphericalShellGrids includes tools for generating spherical shell grids for ocean simulations with Oceananigans.

OrthogonalSphericalShellGrids is developed by the [Climate Modeling Alliance](https://clima.caltech.edu).

## Quick install

OrthogonalSphericalShellGrids is a [registered Julia package](https://julialang.org/packages/). So to install it,

1. [Download Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

2. Launch Julia and type

```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add("OrthogonalSphericalShellGrids")
```

The main purpose of `OrthogonalSphericalShellGrids` is to provide a constructor for the `TripolarGrid`,
which is generated by a
([series of cofocal ellipses perpendicular to a family of hyperbolae](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021999196901369)).
To build a `TripolarGrid` with `OrthogonalSphericalShellGrids`, try writing

```julia
julia> using OrthogonalSphericalShellGrids

julia> grid = TripolarGrid(size=(60, 30, 1))
60×30×1 OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid{Float64, Periodic, Oceananigans.Grids.RightConnected, Bounded} on CPU with 4×4×4 halo and with precomputed metrics
├── centered at (λ, φ) = (70.0, 1.8005)
├── longitude: Periodic  extent 359.885 degrees                          variably spaced with min(Δλ)=0.279019, max(Δλ)=6.32049
├── latitude:  Oceananigans.Grids.RightConnected  extent 175.667 degrees variably spaced with min(Δφ)=0.429975, max(Δφ)=5.86207
└── z:         Bounded  z ∈ [0.0, 1.0]                                   regularly spaced with Δz=1.0
```

The script
[`examples/visualize_tripolar_grid.jl`](https://clima.github.io/OrthogonalSphericalShellGrids.jl/dev/literated/visualize_tripolar_grid/)
generates the following visualization of a `TripolarGrid` with two north poles located at 60 degrees latitude:

A tripolar grid. The North pole singularity (left) has been "healed" by having two poles
at 60 degrees latitude. The South pole (right) retained its singularity. This grid is
particularly useful in ocean modeling so that we avoid having to deal with numerical issues
arising from the North pole singularity within the Arctic ocean.
